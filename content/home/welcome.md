The **Streamware Project** was launched in 2021 to enable users to
develop streaming data-science applications.  The Streamware team
acknowledges the generous support of the National Science Foundation,

*Streamware - A Scalable Framework for Accelerating Streaming Data
Science* as part of the Principles and Practice of Scalable Systems
(PPoSS) program.


In grand-challenge scientific applications, the enormous amount of
data produced by the sensing and instrumentation infrastructure often
loses its value after a small window of time. Thus, to obtain
actionable intelligence from the data, streaming analytics, i.e., the
ability to analyze in-motion data, is increasingly becoming
critical. Moreover, modern computing systems are highly heterogeneous,
consisting of processors, accelerators, and large high-bandwidth
external memories. To develop scalable streaming analytics
applications, challenges across the full system stack -- from
application to target platform -- need to be addressed. In this
regard, this planning project is identifying a comprehensive set of
research challenges, goals, key innovations and timelines in
algorithms and applications, systems software, hardware-software
co-design, and computer architecture. This project is bringing
together a community of application developers and users, computer
scientists, and data scientists, whose interests lie in building
streaming data science applications targeting a wide variety of
scalable systems. This project is demonstrating preliminary results on
how it will achieve significant cross-stack performance improvements
using Privacy Preserving Streaming Graph Learning for Secure Smart
Grids as the driving application.

Modern data-science applications are characterized as being highly
decentralized, distributed and requiring composition and orchestration
between localized analytics on thousands or millions of edge platforms
and massive centralized analytics in cloud/data centers, as well as
requiring real-time analytics on streaming data. To enable scalable
performance of grand-challenge streaming data-science applications, a
framework that allows developers to seamlessly build these
applications targeting a wide variety of scalable systems is
needed. This planning project is conducting preliminary research
towards a large proposal for developing an open-source framework,
StreamWare, that will enable users to develop streaming data-science
applications. This project is establishing a community of application
developers and users, computer scientists, and data scientists who
would serve as early adopters and developers of the StreamWare
framework. In consultation with domain experts, a list of key
data-science kernels for StreamWare is being generated, and their
existing state-of-the-art algorithms and hardware IPs are being
evaluated to identify performance limitations and opportunities for
improvement. This project is also articulating the requirements of
novel abstractions that can represent and operate on streaming data on
heterogeneous platforms. This project uses Privacy Preserving
Streaming Graph Learning for Secure Smart Grids as a motivating
application to show preliminary evidence of end-to-end scalability
using a novel notion of symbiotic scalability that captures the impact
of StreamWare's cross-layer optimizations. The expected outcomes of
this planning project include a proposal for the research activities
to be carried out in the large grant, publications on the results of
the survey activities and future research directions for enabling
streaming data science, and curricula for future graduate and
undergraduate courses.
