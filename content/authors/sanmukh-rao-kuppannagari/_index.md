My research interests are:

- *Accelerating AI on Heterogeneous Platforms*: Develop an Application Specific Processor (ASP) to enable high throughput and low latency FPGA implementations of state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
- *Accelerating Privacy Preserving Machine Learning on FPGAs*: Develop accelerators for Homomorphic Encryption based Machine Learning algorithms to enable development of low-latency privacy preserving machine learning applications.
- *Data Driven Modeling and Optimization for Smart Energy Systems*: Develop data driven combinatorial optimizations, approximation algorithms and Reinforcement Learning algorithms to minimize the cost of smart grid operations.
